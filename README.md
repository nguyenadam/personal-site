If you are seeing this, you are probably me making a change after a few months and have forgotten how to deploy the site.
## How to deploy?
Push to a new branch on github.com. When a PR is created, a preview site will be generated. These changes will automatically be pushed to the web upon a successful merge to master. This is done through ~magic~ one of those fancy github action things!
