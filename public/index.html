    ﻿<h1 id="hey-there-i’m-adam-nguyen" class="heading"><strong>Hey there! I’m Adam Nguyen!</strong></h1>
    <p>I’m a software person currently studying at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at
        Austin</a>. If you want to get in touch, shoot me an email at [my first name][my last name] @ <a
        href="http://utexas.edu">utexas.edu</a>!</p>
    <h1 id="what-i’m-working-on">What I’m working on</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>🧪 I’m currently interning at <a href="https://sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</a> in their internal
          technology department—helping to build and maintain tools to support their mission. Unfortunately, I can’t
          publically announce much of what I do, but if you’re interested in what I do at the labs, please reach out!
      </li>
      <li>💡 <a href="https://lightbulb.education/">Lightbulb Education</a> is an educational services company co-founded
          by me and <a href="https://jchacko.dev">Jonathan Chacko</a>. We’re focused on helping school districts
          implement technology effectively in the classroom through actionable professional development and
          well-designed software. We develop a wide variety of custom solutions, and you can find out more by looking at
          our website!
      </li>
      <li>
        🏫 <a href="https://outreach.uteach.utexas.edu/">UTeach Outreach</a> is the final item on this list, an
          organization that I am extremely happy to be a part of. We help engage elementary and middle school students
          in STEM by bringing college students into their classrooms and allowing them to explore topics that they never
          would be able to in their regular classes. I’m currently taking a break from them over the summer, but I look
          forward to returning in the fall.
