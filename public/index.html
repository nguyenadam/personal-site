    <h1>What I've done in the past</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
          <p>üè´ <a target="_blank" href="https://outreach.uteach.utexas.edu/">UTeach Outreach</a> is an
          organization that I was extremely happy to be a part of. We helped engage elementary and middle school students
          in STEM by bringing college students into their classrooms and allowing them to explore topics that they never
          would have been able to in their regular classes.</p>
      </li>
      
    </ul>
    <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>
        A limited collection of projects that I've worked on... soon to be expanded!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Path tracer!</strong> Everyone and their mother has written a ray tracer at some point
            in their lives, but ray tracers are limited in their ability to accurately render indirect
            illumination. To solve this problem, we introduce path tracing! The idea is that instead
            of just shooting rays from the camera, we also shoot rays from the light source(s) and join 
            those up to create light paths. We do some fancy math to properly weight the paths, and we
            get some pretty cool pictures! You can view the presentation and some cool pictures 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/185aiTYlpkhaQEHvT-ekl-kW1v_ZeNPEbSI99mRxgMOc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
            Unfortunately, the source code is not publically available because the original ray tracer that 
            this was built upon is part of an assignment for UT CS 354H, and posting it online would make the assignment way too easy
            for future students. :)

          <p>
            <strong>Third Person Shooter with Dead Reckoning!</strong> Under the direction of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/sarah-abraham">Sarah Abraham</a>, I created a multiplayer
            third person shooter with some pretty cool networking features. The game does a significant amount of player position prediction across the network,
            which allows a player to see relatively smooth and accurate movement of other players even when latency is super high and most frames are dropped.
            I will get a demo up here on the website eventually!
